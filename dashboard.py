"""Generate a self-contained HTML dashboard from store.json.

No server, no dependencies, no network calls. Regenerate after each pipeline run.

Design notes:
  * Urgency and deadline proximity are shown as colour + text label. The status
    yellow sits below 3:1 contrast on a light surface, so colour alone would not
    be readable for everyone; the label is the mitigation, not decoration.
  * "Updates by agency" is one hue against a muted track (magnitude comparison),
    not a multi-colour categorical set — the agencies aren't competing series.
  * Dark mode is declared under both the OS media query and the data-theme
    scope, so a manual toggle wins in both directions.

# Parked 2026-07-21 on evidence. A bake-off of free models turned up the failure
# this feature cannot afford: the source text of 12 CFR 1002.9 carries only the
# subsection markers (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii), but the answering model cited
# (iii) through (vi) and attached one to each element of the notice, and the
# reconciler then in use (gemma-4-26b) restated all six as fact in its main list
# — a hallucination given citation-level precision. Two other free models
# quarantined and flagged it, so this is model quality, not a design fault.
#
# Scoping the box to the tracked updates removed that specific failure (no CFR
# text in, no subsections to invent) and measured well. It is parked anyway:
# model-written prose under a CRCM's name is a liability posture to take
# deliberately rather than by default, which is the same reasoning that already
# keeps RegAssistant out of this repo.
#
# Preserved and still working: the Worker and its keys, the reconciler order
# measured in the bake-off, corpus.json, ecfr_corpus.py, the in-browser BM25
# retrieval and the whole client path. Unparking is this one flag.
#
# ASK_INCLUDE_REGULATIONS stays False independently. Before setting it True,
# upgrade the ANSWERERS and re-run the bake-off — the fabrication came from an
# answerer reading CFR text, and a better reconciler catches rather than
# prevents it.
#
# The plain keyword search box is a different thing entirely — no model, no
# network — and is unaffected by either flag.

# Navy #003B6A and green #AED136 are taken from kaufmanrossin.com, along with
# its heading grey #3C3C3C and body ink #212529.
#
# The green is used ONLY as a solid accent block (the header bar, panel rules)
# with dark text on top - never for text, thin marks, or anything that carries
# meaning by colour. It measures 1.75:1 against white, well under the 3:1 floor,
# so as a data colour it would be invisible to a lot of readers. That is how the
# firm's own site uses it too.
#
# Navy is too dark to sit on a dark background, so dark mode uses a lighter step
# of the same hue (#4E9BD8), checked against the dark surface.
#
# The wordmark itself: traced from kaufmanrossin.com's own SVG, ink colours
# unchanged. Used in a shared constant rather than duplicated inline because it
# appears twice (header, contact card) and the path data is long.

   Media-query rules carry no extra specificity, so any base rule written

   were silently dead: .panel padding, .card h3 size and line-height,
   .card p size, .contact padding and gap. Phones were quietly served
   desktop spacing and nothing pointed at it - the page just looked a bit
   wrong. Add new base rules ABOVE this block, never below.
   =================================================================== */
/* Phone layout. The desktop proportions put 1,434px of header, counts and
   filters above the first actual update — nearly two full screens of scrolling
   before any content, on the device most LinkedIn traffic arrives from.
   Everything here buys that height back.

   Not width alone. A phone in landscape is around 800px wide, so a plain
   max-width:640px rule handed it the full desktop layout on a 375px-tall
   screen: updates above deadlines, the filter block fully expanded, nothing
   foldable, small tap targets. The pointer test catches a phone in either
   orientation; the width bound keeps large tablets and touch-capable laptops on
   the desktop layout, which is what suits them.

       1. "Export CSV" took 102px of a 366px row, leaving the title 220px and
          forcing the wrap. The button is now hidden outright on phones —
          downloading a spreadsheet is a desktop action, and nobody opens a CSV
          on a handset to do work with it. That returns the whole row to the
          title. The button stays in the markup so its click handler always has
          an element; display:none also takes it out of the tab order, which is
          what we want when it is not offered.
       2. The audience and the timestamp ran together into three ragged lines.
          They are separate blocks now, and the stamp is dimmed — it is
          reference, not a headline.
     The accent rule also drops 4px to 3px: at phone width a 4px bar reads as a
     third element rather than a trim. */
